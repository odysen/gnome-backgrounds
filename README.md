# Odysen Backgrounds

This module contains a set of backgrounds packaged with the GNOME/Odysen desktop.

## Design Guidelines
#### Technical Constraints

GNOME Human Interface Guidelines povide some [background on size and aspect ratio](https://developer.gnome.org/hig/reference/backgrounds.html) for the wallpapers.

##### File size

Unfortunately due to distribution limits, the background collection has to keep its size contrained to around 40MB. This forces us to replace assets rather than add them. You can download the [Nostalgia](https://flathub.org/apps/details/im.bernard.Nostalgia) app to view previous release wallpapers.

One wallpaper is reserved for plain color to be used for remote access where it's beneficial for the compression algorithm to cope with it with ease. 

##### Color Banding

Images should look decent even on lower quality displays. Techniques such as dithering should be used for elements with low contrast areas that would otherwise be prone for color banding.
